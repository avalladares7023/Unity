 -> Majority of the issues is related to the imports and the build path though I am currently trying to fix the issue by 
    configuring the build path in Eclipse.
 -> May need to install Android Studio since at it's core it is a Java IDE with added Android development tools.

The difference between Java Development Kit (JDK) and the Android Development (ADK)
* JDK
  - JDK is used to develop Java applications and contains the jars, libraries, and tools that allows us to write and 
    compile java files that can run on the JRE (Java Runtime Environment).
  - In android apps, JDK provides logical operations
* ADK
  - ADK contains the support for emulators and tools to help with developing Android apps. The development kit is 
    essentially uses Java with the only difference being certain packages.
  - In android apps, the android SDK provides the GUI, APIs, and other hardware operations for android os
  - Android Software Development Tools:
    	> Android Studio
    	> Gradle
	> IntelliJ IDEA
  - Directory Layout
    -> manifests
    ----> It seems that it utilizes .xml to help describe the fundamental characteristics of the application and define 
    	  each of its components
    -> java
    -> res
    ----> drawable
    -------> drawable-hdpi is a directory for drawable objects that are designed for high-density screens
    ----> layout
    -------> this is a directory for files that define the app's UI
    ----> values
    -------> this is a directory for other various XML files that contain a collection of resources, like strings 
	     and colors definition
    -> Gradle Scripts
